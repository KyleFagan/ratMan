# ratMan
A packMan clone I made for fun.

Currently has random walls. I might make a large number of pre-made board layouts instead so they look nicer but have random generation as an option.
Board can be any size. Everything scales pretty well. I've tried 10x10 to 100x100.

Currently this game is partially broken. I changed the way it places everything for scaling and it has a bug.
